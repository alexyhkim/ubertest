I chose to complete the SF movies challenge. The demo is hosted at http://ubertest.herokuapp.com/.

The search bar loads when the SF movies data has been retrieved. Upon typing into the search bar, an autocomplete pops down. Clicking a result will place markers at locations the movie was filmed on the map and fill the box with info about the movie. The markers can be clicked to show their addresses.
